<p>Welcome to our 2012 year-end blog. It is also available
in <a href="fim-de-2012.html">Portuguese</a>.  If you wish to catch up with previous editions <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~amaral/end-of-year-letter">you can find them here</a>.</p>

	<p> After the Christmas and New Year holidays in Oklahoma we
          were back in Edmonton for our traditional
          Christmas-after-Christmas party at home in January
          2012. This year the guests included some of Daniel's closest
          friends: the German twins Deniz and Sinan, the Greek
          extraction Alexander N, and the half-Norwegian Sander, along
          with their siblings and parents. The house was full of
          laugh, playing and fun. Nothing says "Christmas" like a
          noisy house full of kids and the smells of a Christmas
          dinner. We were also happy that our great friend Fran could
          join us, likely for the last time for this traditional
          event, since she moved to Australia in March.</p>

<p>We dived right back into hockey season in January, which
        lasted until the end of March. Not only Daniel was having
        practices and games twice a week with his "Silver Bullets"
        team, he also did additional "power skating" training and,

               align="left"> </a> <br>
        given that I had a VIP pass as a Senator for the University of
        Alberta, me and Daniel were also going to almost every home
        game for the University of Alberta's Golden Bears hockey
        team. Daniel knew several of the players personally because of
        his hockey Summer camps where the Golden Bear players are
        coaches. We also went to several Oil Kings games at Rexall
        Place, the home fo the famous Oilers team. One with his Silver
        Bullets team, and several with his great friend Denis C. We
        even saw the final of the Western Hockey League (WHL) where

               align="right"> </a> <br>
        the Kings took the cup.  During the regular season he raised
        up from being in the lower ranks of the team to being one of
        the top players at the end of march. Then at the end of March
        Daniel got a last-minute invitation to join the 2004
        University of Alberta Jr. Golden Bear team. We jumped at the
        opportunity and thus extended our hockey season all the way to

        June. Sometimes with four practices in the same
        weekend. Overlapping hockey with the Spring Soccer season was
        challenging for scheduling and on the two daddies, but it was
        well worth it. Daniel thrived on both sports.</p>

        <p>Daniel's soccer team was formed mostly by his friends from
        grade 2. They went through half of the season without taking
        any goals. They kept being re-tiered up and playing farther
        and farther away from home to face tougher teams and they kept
        dominating the games. They finished the season at the end of
        June as the undefeated champions for the region where they
        played. This was great because his hockey team had lost most
        of their games. Thus it was a great balance and we saw Daniel
        becoming a much more gracious winner or loser of a game.</p>

	<p>All this investment in sport activities proved to be a very
	wise decision. Because the confidence that Daniel garnered
	from sports helped him in school. Daniel struggles
	academically because of his ADHD and learning difficulties.
	Before his success in sport his academic struggles were
	affecting his self esteem. But success in sport gave him great
	confidence and significantly improved his academic progress
	and his relationships in school. For instance, when his class
	went ice-skating, he was one fo the top skaters and was
	admired by all his classmates and teachers.</p>

        <p>My Spring academic travels took me to Boston and to Tallin
        in Estonia. I was very pleasantly surprised by Boston, a great
        city and Tallin is a fairly small but very charming European
        old capital with an old downtown and very nice modern
        buildings. I found Tallin to have a much more Scandinavian
        feel than I expected before going there. On my way back from
        Tallin, I managed to have dinner with my good friend Silvia in
        Amsterdam and it was nice to catch up with her. Then in the
        Summer I went to Beijing for my first visit ever to China. I
        stayed very close to the Bird Nest stadium and got to visit
        Tiannamen Square, the Forbidden City and a segment of the
        Great Wall. It was one of the most interesting trips that I
        took in a while. I was happy with the godd reception by my
        colleagues for one of my talks at a conference in
        Beijing. </p>

	<p> In the Spring we also were sad to have to say good bye to
	  our great friend Fran Moore who left Edmonton to follow her
	  husband to Australia.</p>

 <p> In the Spring I was also honoured to be invited to be the
	keynote speaker for the graduation banquet for the Computing
	Science class at the University of Alberta. This been the
	100th aninversary of the birthday of Alan Turing, and I been
	the only openly gay professor in the department, I made the
	speech about the personal life and contributions of Alan
	Turing to Science. Turing is today regarded as the father of
	Computing Science. He has made great contributions to Science
	and played a decisive role in the Second World war. But he was
	also prosecuted for being gay, subjected to chemical
	castration by the British courts, and committed suicide before
	his 44th birthday. Turing also most likely suffered from
	Asperger's Syndrome. I made the speech about the need for
	acceptance and embracing of people that are different. The
	speech was very well received and regarded as one of the best
	graduation speeches ever by senior colleagues that were
	there.</p>

	<p>In July we had our own version of ``family vacation.'' I
	dropped Daniel off in Dallas with his grandparents where he
	spend about ten days playing with his cousins and American
	friends and enjoying Summer activities. Scott went into a
	hiking and camping trip to the mountains in Alberta. I went on
	to Madrid where I was chairing the program committe for a
	conference. This time I rented an apartment instead of staying
	in a hotel and it was a great experience. Madrid was very nice
	in spite of all the street protests against the austerity
	measures and in spite of the fact that I was pick-pocketed and
	lost my credit cards.</p>

	<p>The grandparents brought Daniel back to Edmonton in time
	for us to have his two traditional birthday celebrations. For
	his kids' party we brought back the idea of Grandma's store
	and Daniel Dollars, which was a great success now that all the
	kids could properly manage their money. Grandma Juana had some
	great ideas for carnival style games which made the party
	really fun, and Timur, Daniel's very successful soccer coach
	organized a soccer game during the party, which was much fun
	but tarnished by a cloud of Edmonton's only Summer super-sized
	mosquito!</p>

	<p>After searching for several years, in June Scott found a
	suitable liquor store to buy so that he could go ahead with
	his project of owning his own wine store. We made the decision
	to acquire the store and set up the ownership transfer day for
	the end of August after our trip to Brazil. Ashton's Liquor is
	named after the son of the previous owner. The store was doing
	well mostly on liquor and beer sales before Scott took it over
	early in September. Scott has a great knowledge of wines as he
	has been studying wines for several years. He is now taking
	his third level of the Somellier training courses, which
	entails eight hours of wine-tasting classes every Sunday for a
	period of six months. This far Scott's approach to promote
	wines at the store has been a great success. People have been
	raving about the quality of the wines that he is bringing into
	the store, and he is focusing in a very reasonable price point
	(under Ca$ 20/25 price range). He was surprised by the volume
	of sales of higher-priced wines prior to Christmas. Meanwhile
	beer sales remain strong and had brought in some new scotch
	and vodkas that are selling very well. The life of a
	small-business owner is very busy and our family life has
	changed significantly. But it is great to see Scott very happy
	about his new enterprise.</p>
 
	<p> In August, after Daniel's birthday celebrations, we went
	to Brazil for vacations with my family. This time we flew to
<a href="pictures/JoaoPessoa-Chimarrao.jpg">
	  <img src="thumbnails/JoaoPessoa-Chimarrao.jpg" border=0
               alt="Family in Joao Pessoa Drinking Chimarrao"
               align="left"> </a>
	my brother's house in Bras&iacute;lia and from there we took a
	vacation with my immediate family in Jo&atilde;o Pessoa in the
	Northeast of Brazil. It was a great time to all of us. We
	spent time in three different locations during the week,
	everybody was happy and relaxed. After Joao Pessoa, Daniel,

               alt="Family on the Beach"

	Scott, and myself made a special trip to Cuiab&aacute; to go visit
	our friends Jo&atilde;o and Ot&aacute;vio in Chapada dos Guimar&atilde;es. We
	had planned this trip almost a year in advance and our main
	goal was to reconnect with Joao who Scott has not seem for 18
	years (I saw Jo&atilde;o the year before in
	Bras&iacute;lia). Unfortunately Jo&atilde;o decided to stay in S&atilde;o Paulo
	in the last minute, thus frustating our efforts to reconnect
	with him. Nonetheless we had a great visit with Ot&aacute;vio and
	enjoyed his wonderful hospitality and to get to know a bit of
	Chapada dos Guimar&atilde;es. A beutiful location one hour outside
	of Cuiab&aacute;.</p>

After the weekend in Cuiaba we went back to Bras&iacute;lia to
	spend some quiet time with my mom, stepfather Geovany, my
	brother Marco and his wife Fernanda. The day after we got to
	Brasilia Scott developed a blood clot in his Safena and had to
	be hospitalized for three days as a precaution. Thus Daniel
	and I spent the rest of our vacation making visits to the
	hospital every day. Nonetheless we had a good time and would
	spend time with Geovany in the afternoon. Geovany was not too
	well, but he was keen on going see Scott in the hospital and
	to come and see Daniel play soccer with the Brazilian kids in
	the house complex. Just a couple of weeks after we came back
	from Brazil, Geovany had a stroke and died. We consider

               align="right"> </a>
	ourselves fortunate that we got to spend quality time with him
	in what turned out to be the last few weeks of his life.</p>

	<p>A great bonus of our visit to Bras&iacute;lia was that my
	brother's first grandson, Gael, was born while we were there
	and we got to visit with Tiago, Tatiana, and Gael.</p>

	<p>Daniel's hockey league has a very structured one-month
	evaluation to assign players to different tiers. This
	evaluation includes both skating skills and game
	smartness. There are eight tiers with the top players in tier
	#1. Last year Daniel was in a tier 8 team. This year, after
	evaluation, he was slotted into a tier #3 team. The skill level
	in this team is much higher and almost all the dads were
	pretty good hockey players themselves when they were
	younger. They push their kids and take all things hockey very
	seriously. Scott and I are the odd guys in this group as we do
	not have hockey in our DNA.</p>

	  In September I went to Minneapolis to attend an
	international conference where one of our papers, that resulted
	from research done by one of my students with an IBM team, was
	nominated for the best paper award. This work was with the new
	IBM Blue Gene/Q machine, the fastest machine in the world this
	year. Not only we got the best paper award, but my student,
	Matthew Gaudet, also received the gold medal (top prize) in
	the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student research
	competition. We were all extremely happy with the awards.</p>

	<p>Then in November, when I went to attend the Center for
	Advanced Studies Conference (CASCON) in Markham in Ontario I
	was surprised to have been selected as the <i>2012 Faculty
	Fellow of the Year</i> by the Canadian Centre for Advanced
	Studies of IBM. Of course I was very happy with the
	recognition of the work done by my students in this very
	fruitful relationship with IBM.</p>

        <p>A big change this year around our house has been the
        arrival of a large contingent of undergraduate students from
        Brazil within the Science Without Borders (SWB) program. We
        started interacting with some of them soon after their
        arrival. There are about fifty of them and most are living
        accross the street from our house in the student
        residences. We grew very close to some of them. In September
        we had a large group for a welcoming party at our place. They
        enjoyed a typical Brazilian meal. I wish I had more time to
        interact closer with more of the students in this group. It is
        a great group of students. It also made our life so much
        easier because we could rely on some of them for child minding
        when we needed it in the occasions in which Scott had to be at
        the store and I had to be elsewhere. I am sure we will miss
        this group when they have to go back to Brazil in the
        Summer.</p>

	<p>At home we have been trying to help our next-door neighbor
	Dorothy cope with the routine necessities of life around a

	watch her slowly becoming less able to do routine tasks. She

	<p>At the University I was extremely busy during the Fall term
	because I decided to teach all my courses in the Fall in order
	to be more flexible in the Winter and Spring to do research
	and to travel. Besides teaching, research, and student
	advising, I have also been very involved in University
	Governance as a member of the General Faculties Council and of
	the University Senate. At the department level I have
	championed the creation of joint graduate programs with
	Unicamp in Brazil. Although these roles consume time, they
	also allow me to have a much broader circle of relations and
	to be acquainted with a group that supports the
	university.</p>

	<p>Daniel and I are now in the airplane in our way to Oklahoma. This is
	the second day that we are trying to fly and are again delayed
	for more than three hours because of mechanical problems. It
	has been very frustrating, but we are coping well. We are
	looking forward to several relaxing days at Scott's parents
	house. Scott will not be able to join us because this is his
	first year with the store and the wife of one of his main
	employees is having a baby around Christmas. Thus Scott has to
	stay in Edmonton to make sure that the store remains open
	around the holidays.</p>
