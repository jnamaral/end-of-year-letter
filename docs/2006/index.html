 2005 and the New Year in Xangril&aacute; in the coast of the South
 Atlantic. We rented a house half-a-block from Vov&oacute; Dioraci's
 house at the beach. We celebrated Christmas with Summer weather, then
 we helped Vov&oacute; organize a very large party for Vov&ocirc;
 Geovany's 80th birthday on Dec. 31st. After that we still had plenty
 of time for excursions to a local waterfall and to walk the bottom of
 the Itaimbezinho, a beautiful local Canyon in the northeast of Rio
 Grande do Sul.

 Edmonton, Grandpa and Gag&aacute; (Daniel's name for Grandma Juana)
 came to visit. They joined us in another tradition: our January
 Christmas-After-Christmas party in Edmonton. Because we will likely
 spend Christmas away from home for years to come, we created this
 party as a way for Daniel to have a Christmas tradition at
 home. Daniel got his first battery-powered car from Gag&aacute;. This
 car has been a success with kids in all our parties.

 Edmonton this year. Daniel was riding his little car outside in
 February! In the end of March I went to Vienna in Austria to attend a
 conference for a week. Scott and Daniel took the time to go to
 Oklahoma to spend time with Grandpa, Gag&aacute; and the extended
 family. Daniel "helped" grandpa with his filing and with the lawn
 mowing. He also got great wagon rides from cousin Braden.

 he could. Papai got some great assistance with the kneading of the bread
 one morning; and Daddy's vegetable garden would not have been the
 same without Daniel's valuable help. Later in the Summer Daniel
 helped Papai harvest the potatoes.  During the Fall Papai have been
 also busy on weekends with a do-it-yourself basement remodeling
 project. Often Daniel goes down to help out with his hammer and his
 screwdriver. But he does not like when Papai uses the drill or the
 electric saw because they are noisy and scary. Daniel was not too keen on his
 first haircut early in the Summer.

I started traveling in June to attend conferences again, this time to Ottawa
and Toronto. Later in June Grandpa and Gag&aacute; returned to
Edmonton for another visit. Daniel got his first baby grand-piano. He
loved it. He seems to have a thing for music. We had time to go out
and root for the Brazilian team just before they got kicked out of the
World Cup. Also with the Oilers in the playoffs for the Stanley Cup,
Daniel got hooked in hockey. He would wake up in the morning and ask
for the Sports Channel, When we would seat down at night to
watch Teletubies he would ask for "Hockey! Hockey!" Of course grandpa
obliged and played several hockey games with him. Daniel is turning
out to be a little sport jock. He likes soccer, hockey, baseball, and
golf.

 of June for a month-long vacation. While Daniel stayed home with
 Grandpa and Gag&aacute; we took Maiara for a horse-back riding trip
 to the <a href="http://www.tonquinvalley.com/">Tonquin Valley</a>
 close to Jasper. We stayed in a back-country lodge in the Valley
 and enjoyed wonderful vistas. Once we were back to Edmonton we had
 time for visits to the Saint Albert's outdoor Farmer's Market and for
 picnics.

We were fortunate to have both the American grandparents and
 Vov&oacute; in the house for one day in July. Vov&oacute; arrived the
 day before Grandpa and Gag&aacute; left. We had enough time to have a
 meal together and to take some rare pictures including Daniel's two
 grandmas.

 of Vov&oacute;, came with her. Thus we went on a driving trip to
 Jasper and the surrounding area. We took the gondola up to <a
 href="http://www.jaspertramway.com/"> Whistler Mountain </a>, had
 several picnics, and took a boat ride on <a
 href="http://www.malignelake.com/">Maligne Lake</a>. We got to see
 quite a bit of wild life and enjoyed some afternoon tea at the
 world-class <a
 href="http://www.purewest.com/accommodations/jpl/index.html">Jasper
 Park Lodge</a>. Daniel's highlights in this trip included throwing
 stones into lakes, picking up sticks, playing with big-truck tires,
 and similar excitement of a road trip.  Back in Edmonton the
 visitors had several sightseeing and shopping opportunities and kept
 busy.

 had Vov&oacute; for himself and we enjoyed a lovely quiet time at
 home. Lots of great home-cooked meals, afternoon strolling to the
 playground, and great time in the backyard.  With Vov&oacute;'s
 encouragement Daniel became a great puddle jumper, and they also did
 other exciting things such as picking up pine cones.  Vov&oacute; was
 also very busy preparing all kinds of sweets, small savory bites, and
 a delicious passion-fruit cake for Daniel's second birthday party. We
 had several friends over in our garden to celebrate Daniel's
 birthday. Soon after that Vov&oacute; returned to Brazil.

 In September Emily's parents, Howard and Liz, contacted us. Emily is
 Daniel's middle sister who was adopted at birth. When Daniel was born
 we sent them some pictures and a note about us. Now that Emily was
 ready to meet her little brother they contacted us. We traveled to
 Calgary on a weekend and Daniel had a great time playing with
 Emily. The next day we spent a few hours visiting with Mac, Daniel's
 oldest sister. We took the opportunity to take a picture with Diane,
 Daniel's birth grandmother, and Mac.

Scott has been working from home all year on his engineering
consulting business. His company is called Consicuro. He is also in a
partnership with a USA-based consulting firm called Kenexis. In
September and early October Scott went on a three-week-long trip to
Trinidad to work on a Kenexis project and from there he went to
Alabama to teach some engineering training courses. I had a flavor for
the busy life of a working single parent during those weeks.  Every
night Daniel would say: "Daddy went in the airplane to Chikidad. Daddy
come back."

<a href="pictures/Snow.jpg">
<img src="thumbnails/Snow.jpg" border=0 alt="Daniel in first Snow"
 align="right"> </a> Next day after his return, Scott had a day
 surgery to repair a hernia and was walking on clutches for a few
 days. Daniel was very concerned about "Daddy's aui." He would say
 often to daddy "Be careful Daddy. Be careful." We were lucky that
 Grandpa and Gag&aacute; were able to come back to Edmonton to help us
 out. Just a couple of days after the surgery I had to go to Toronto
 for a conference, and they were very helpful keeping our house
 running and taking care of Daniel and Daddy. Grandpa returned home
 soon, but Gag&aacute; stayed until early November so that she could
 be in Edmonton while I went to New Orleans for yet another conference
 in the end of October. Snow arrived in mid-October and Daniel went
 out to play with Daddy and Grandma. Grandma got Daniel a little
 shopping cart that he loves to push around when he goes out
 shopping. He also uses it to carry his "baby" around in the
 house. The baby was a present from Vov&oacute; this Summer. Whenever
 Daniel has to take medicine or clip his nails, the baby does it
 first.

With grandma around, Halloween was a big affair around our house. We
 had some decorations, carved a pumpkin and dressed up Daniel. Daniel
 had a party at day care, and also went to a Halloween party in our
 neighborhood association - where the haunted house was very
 "s-c-a-r-y". On Halloween night it was very cold thus we limited
 trick-or-treat to our immediate neighbors. Daniel seems to be a trill
 seeker. I took him to the West Edmonton Mall to see a mechanical
 fire-spitting dragon that is at the entrance of a movie theater
 complex. He was scared and he talked about the dragon been
 "scaaary". But when we were going away and were at a safe distance
 from the dragon he said " I like the dragon!"
</p>

<p>
Early in December I had to go in yet another trip. This time to a
conference that took place in a Disney-world resort in Orlando. Daniel
protested that he wanted to go in the airplane to Mickey-Mouse house,
not Papai.
</p>

<p>
Daniel is already very aware of his special family arrangements. When
calling both of us he often says "Come on daddies." And the fact that
Daniel has two daddies is talked about a lot by his classmates in
day care. Actually in November we were told that he is already using it
for one-manship over his colleagues. Sometimes they get into shouting
arguments. One day they were all shouting "My Mummy!", "No, my
Mummy!", and Daniel shouted "My Papai!" The other toddlers were
stunned because they did not have a Papai to shout about. Sometimes
when I show up to pick up Daniel at day care I get a five-toddler group
hug, and they all yell "Daniel's Papai!"
</p>

<p> I had a very good year at the University. I have a great team of
students that keeps me busy with exciting exploration of ideas, result
analysis, and paper writing. We had a high-water mark in terms of
publications this year. We were very proud that our research team was
selected the "Team of the Year", by the IBM Center for Advanced
Studies in Toronto, thanks to our contributions to IBM's mission. I
also took new responsibilities, on top of my associate chair for
graduate student duties, in high-level governance committees on
campus. It is good to branch out of the department and connect with
the whole institution.
<p>

<p> Now we are getting ready to go to Oklahoma to spend Christmas with
Scott's family. Daniel talks about going in the airplane to visit
Gag&aacute; and Grandpa in "Homa".
