This letter is also available
in <a href="fim-de-2007.html">Portuguese</a>.  As you know, our year
has acquired a rithm by now, and this one has follow a similar
pattern: Christmas with family in Oklahoma, followed by a
Christmas-after-Christmas cellebration at home in mid January and my
department's ski trip to Jasper at the end of January where I
celebrated my birthday with a nice dinner at Andy's (a nice restaurant
in Jasper).</p>

<p>In January we went to the animal shelter and adopted a new member for
our family, Berry II, a five-year old cat that certainly belonged to
another family with kids and that demonstrated very quickly that he
new how to train his human servants. For instance, within a few hours
of being home he "told" me that he drinks water from a running tap in
the bathtub. He is also very particular about the clealingness of his
litter box and will say, in no uncertain terms, when it is time for it
to be changed. He was very affectionate to Daniel at the shelter, but
then after establishing himself at home, he merely tolerates Daniel,
but slips away as soon as he has a chance, which is a good thing given
that a blood test revealed that Daniel is actually allergic to cats.</p>

<p>Daniel continues to like to help with selected projects around the
house. Sometimes he can get very involved in cooking. Using the
powerwash on the deck and house in the Spring time, and helping Daddy
to dig in the garden are also popular tasks to volunteer for. Picking
toys or cloathes around the house not as much. </p>

<p>In February Daniel and I went to see a hockey game in the Oiler's
arena with Bjorn and Sander (a friend of Daniel and his father). We
saw the Oiler Kings play against the Lethbridge team, they lost. But
it was a nice experience for Daniel because Bjorn had got us to go to
one of the sky boxes and Daniel thought that it was very cool. In
February, and then again in December, we had so much snow accumulated
in our backyard that we could build a small hill for Daniel to sled
down on a cardboard box. We have spent many hours building snow
structures, and simply enjoying role playing in the snow in the
backyard.</p>

<p>In March I went on my now regular trip to Europe for a
conference. This time it was in Pathos, in Cyprus. I made a stop in
Prague on both ways to make the long haul flights more berable.</p>

<p>In May we went on a family vacation to Playa Del Carmen. We rented a
house. My sister Salete came from Brazil, Scott's parents went down
from Oklahoma and we flew in from Edmonton with a overnight stop in
Toronto. We also could use the pool in a resort next door and Daniel
enjoyed many days of sun and pool. The rented house came with a maid
and cook, which made the stay much more relaxing. We visited Tulum as
a group, but Daniel was more interested on the beach/pool, thus on
other days Scott took some of them to see other sights while I stayed
with Daniel at the beach.</p>

<p>In May Daniel and myself drove to Calgary to visit his two
birth-sisters and his birth-mom --- Scott could not go because he had
to work. It was a short visit, but we had a great time. This time
Daiel was very nervous about meeting his Mom. It seemed like this was
the first time that he was fully aware of his relationship with
her. He was very happy that the visit went very well.</p>

<p>Also in May, Daniel had his second choral concert. He had been
rehearsing with a group called Cantillon for the whole year. During
the concert he lost his second tooth. Since then he has lost several
more and new ones are growing.</p>

<p>In July Daniel got very much into the World Cup. His favorite teams
were Brazil and Germany, but he would not be shy about switching
allegiances based on who was winning each game as he always wanted to
be rooting for the winning team. I watched the final games of the
World cup in Berlin. I spent about 10 days between Berlin and Vienna
in July to present papers at two conferences. I was disappointed that
Germany did not make it to the finals because it would have been cool
to see a final with Germany from Berlin.</p>

<p>While I was in Europe Scott and Daniel went to Oklahoma to Gaga's
house. Gaga made this into a very special time for Daniel. She invited
many of Daniel's cousins of similar age to come and stay too. They had
a great time at the pool, the large backyard, and fishing in Grandpa's
large fish pond at the back.</p>

<p>Once the Summer travels were done, I took some days off to paint the
outside of our house a new color, it is a deep red called "new
brick". I was done just in time for Gaga' and Grandpa's visit for the
two large parties to celebrate Daniel's birthday. The kids party was
on a Wednesday evening at a large park in the River Valley in Edmonton
and the team of the party was "Soaring kites", the kids had a
blast. Then on that weekend we had a large "almost no-kid" party for
Daniel at home where we served home-made gourmet hamburguers for our
friends.</p>

<p>Daniel is very much into playing "pretend soccer" and "pretend hockey"
with Daddy and Papai. These are games that follow "Daniel's rules"
which means that scores by Daddy or Papai most of the time "doesn't
count." While the weather was nice we benefited a lot from the very
nice artificial turf that the University has accross the street from
our house. During the cold weather we play floor hockey in the large
room that I built in our basement.</p>

<p>Once more we participated in the "Turkey Trot" fundraising for United
Way with folks from our department in early October. Late in October I
did a whirlwind trip to Petropolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and
then went for a day-and-a-half visit to my Mom, step-father and sister
in Maceio, in the Northeast of Brazil where they were on
vacation. While there we had a worderful restaurant called "Wanchaco"
which is regarded by some as one of the top 10 restaurants in
Brazil. I finish my trip with two very long working days in Toronto. </p>

<p>While I was away, Gaga and Grandpa came to spend halloween with Daniel
and Daddy. This year Daniel was a policeman for halloween.  They had a
great time participating on pumpkin parades in school, dressing up,
going to parties and, of course, trick or treating.</p>

<p>This Summer Scott decided that he would put behind him all the sorrow
over not getting tenure at the University and decided to look for
something new to do. He realized that what he really likes is academic
research. Thus he start inquires about research positions. Soon he was
offered a research position by a friend of ours that is a professor in
the Faculty of Medicine. Thus he has been working since September on
mathematical models of the system of patients suffering from chronic
fatigue. He works from home, and he is enjoying being involved in
academic research again.</p>

<p>Daniel started first-grade in September. He has decided to be the
class clown and is more interested on doing "funny stuff" than on the
academic aspects of the educational system. If you ask him what he
likes the most about school he will not hesitate: "recess!" The second
think that he likes the most: "lunch!" As a matter of fact, he was
having so much fun at lunch time that now we take him to eat his lunch
at home most of the days.  The issue is that what is "funny stuff" for
him and his friends is often seem as "imature behaviour" by
discipline-oriented teaching staff. We have been working on strategies
with the school to try to get him on a successful path. We are
fortunate that he is in a very good public school and the principal
and teachers are willing to work with us to help him.</p>

<p>Talking about "funny stuff," five mintues within a visit by Emily
(Daniel's half sister) and her parents to our house in November,
Daniel flushed a rubber ball down the downstairs toilet. The ball was
just the right size to get so stuck that even after removing the
toilet I could not dislodge it. Thus we end up with a single bathroom
for their visit and I had to call Brian, a friend who is a plumber, to
help dislodge the ball with the proper equipment. After the toilet was
stuck, Daniel and Emily were very diligent about making a very good
sign to alert people that the toilet was broken.</p>

<p>We are now on our way to Vovo's beach house in Xangrila' in the South
of Brazil where we will spend Christmas and New years with my whole
family and friends. We plan to enjoy the beach and also to go up to
the touristic hill area in the North of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

<p> We hope you have great holidays with your family.</p>

 
                             Nelson, Scott & Daniel
