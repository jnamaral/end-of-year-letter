<h2 align="center">2002: Making a Home in Alberta</h2>
    <br>
    Last time we managed to put an end-of-year letter together was at the 
end  of 2000. We had moved from Delaware to Alberta in Canada on that year, 
had  taken jobs at the University of Alberta, and had bought a house built 
in 1954 across the street from the campus of the university. We were then 
planning  a major remodeling of the house. <br>

  </a>  The remodeling did take place in 2001. We lived in a dusty and sometimes
  cold basement from February to June of that year. The house was pretty
much   gutted and put back together. We added many windows, made the kitchen
very   open, improved insulation, re-plumbed, etc. The main parts of the
interior   of the house are now done. Although we moved upstairs in June
of 2001, the   final touches on the house were not completed until the end
of that year.  <br>
    <br>
    We were also quite busy during 2001 with traveling. I went to the Canary
  Islands, Genova, and September 11 found me in a nice spot in Brazil. Scott 
 spent another period in London for his annual Navy active duty period, but 
 then took a leave of absence from his Navy job, thus he was not traveling 
 as much to Seattle, but we both kept traveling to different places in North 
 America as both of our jobs require attending several conferences. <br>

 </a>   For Christmas and New Year of 2001 we went back to the South of Brazil, 
 rented a house at a <a
 href="http://www.santa-catarina.net/ciudades/portobelo.htm">nice spot at 
 the beach</a> and spend about 12 days with my immediate family. My niece 
and nephew have grown a lot. We again had a great time cooking, taking long 
walks along the beach, going for boat rides, etc.<br>
    <br>
    I was happy to host several professional colleagues here in Edmonton
in  the Winter term. In January we went for our annual departmental Ski trip
 to Jasper. As I decided that skiing is not for me I took up snow shoeing
through the woods with a group of non-skiers. We also went again through
the <a
 href="http://www.jasperbeyondthebeatenpath.com/winter-icewalk.htm">Maligne 
 Canyon </a>crawl, a wonderful experience in a beautiful canyon. We walked 
 over the frozen river and saw beautiful cascading frozen water falls.<br>

 </a>&nbsp;   After a busy Winter term (that is the way they call what is 
known as the  ``Spring term'' in the USA here --- for a reason), my annual 
travel to Europe  took me to Grenoble in France and Berlin in Germany. I enjoyed
very much both visits. Visiting Berlin was very special because of all the
different  layers of dramatic history that are evident in that place. In
the meantime  we also re-hired our home re-modelers to add a deck to the back
of the house  and to redo the front and back steps, and all the walks around
the house.<br>
    <br>

 </a>&nbsp;   Starting at the end of June, we had a very busy Summer.  Nonetheless 
we  had time to host a bbq in our newly completed back deck for my gay and 
lesbian  swimming team. We were very fortunate with good weather for all our
back yard events this Summer. We received professional colleagues from Quebec
and Michigan, and went back to the <a
 href="http://www.brewsteradventures.com/ShadowLake/">Shadow Lake Lodge</a>.
   A group of primitive but very comfortable cabins up in the mountain close 
 to a lake. You only can get there hiking or on horses. They provide very 
good food, and we spent the days hiking to different beautiful spots.<br>

 </a>   Scott's parents came to visit along with his brother Brett and his 
nephew  Braden in July. We went with the entire group to visit Drumheller 
and see  the <a href="http://www.tyrrellmuseum.com">world-class dinosaur museum</a>
 there. We even had a chance to try to feed Braden to a dinosaur, but he
would  not take him. We also explored several sites in Edmonton, such as
the <a href="http://www.fortedmontonpark.com">Fort Edmonton Park</a>. After
Scott's  parents went home, we took Brett and Braden to a <a
 href="http://www.brewsteradventures.com/kgrhorse.html">horse back riding 
 trip</a> through the Kananaskis area. We spent three days riding horses, 
6 to 8 hours a day, and stayed in cabins in the back country. The views were 
 just magnific, and we had lots of fun. Braden said that it was one of the 
 best vacations that he ever had.<a href="pictures/Dinosaur.jpg"><img

 </a>    That was in spite of some frequent whining after several hours on 
the back  of a horse during <a href="pictures/TP.jpg"><img

 align="right">
 </a>   the trip (which I could relate to!). In one of the pics you can see 
Scott  going into the TP for his morning shower.<br>

    Edmonton hosted several conferences in the areas of artificial intelligence
  and databases at the end of the Summer. My Ph.D. adviser attended one of
 the conferences, and brought his family with him. It was very nice to catch
 up with them and see how much the kids have grown. <br>

 </a>   My mom, my step-dad, and my sister arrived in early August. We rented 
a  motor home and went for a tour of the province of Alberta for 9 days. We
started in the badlands/Drumheller area, and finished in the Kananaskis region
(where they had have the G-8 summit in June). This was the first time that
any one of us had traveled on a motor home. It was very enjoyable and confortable.
 The campsites in Alberta are very well equipped and confortable, and we
liked  to be able to be together, playing cards and visiting while traveling
from  one site to another. My mom and my stepfather were quite impressed
with the  fact that there was still snow in the mountains at the end of the
Summer.  Kananaskis is a beautiful mountain region. We had lots of fun cooking
together,  playing games, and visiting. <br>
    <br>
    When we made back to Edmonton we were quite busy visiting several of
the   sites around here, including the Fort Edmonton Park where there re-enact
 the early settlers life and show several historical periods, the <a
 href="http://www.cd.gov.ab.ca/enjoying_alberta/museums_historic_sites/site_listings/ukrainian_heritage_village/index.asp">Ukrainian
  Village</a> where they re-enact one day in the life of the small village 
 in the 1920s, the <a href="http://www.westedmall.com/home/homepage.asp">West 
 Edmonton Mall</a>, and the Devonian Botanical Gardens.<br>
    <br>
    We were also busy getting ready for our big 10-year anniversary party 
that  took place on August 18. We had a beautiful warm sunny day, many of 
our friends  attended. We were specially thrilled that our neighbors from 
Delaware were  traveling through Alberta and managed to work our celebration 
in their travel  plans. We hired Heather Bishop, a Canadian folk singer to 
entertain. It was  a lovely day, we received well wishes from friends all 
over the world and  were very happy. Most of you have seen the <a

  celebration</a> on my web site.<br>

    <a href="pictures/Garden.jpg"><img src="thumbnails/Garden.jpg"
 alt="Mom in the Garden" width="70" height="64" align="left">
 </a>   In spite of all this activities, we managed to have a nice vegetable 
garden.  And my Mom enjoyed very much the opportunity to harvest fresh salad 
greens  and vegetables to cook some of our meals.<br>
    <br>
    In April we started the process to adopt a child. We attended a workshop 
 in June, and finished our ``dear birth parents'' letter late in August soon 
 after my family left. With this we entered ``the pool'' of waiting prospective 
 adoptive parents. We now have to wait for a birth mother to pick us as her 
 chosen adoptive family. In recent communication with the <a
 href="http://www.adoptionbychoice.ab.ca/">adoption agency</a>, we learned 
 that our file is moving quite slowly through the process, and our expectation 
 is that we will be waiting 2-3 years before we have ''a matching''. A gay 
 couple that live close to us adopted a baby a year ago, from time to time 
 we babysit for them.<br>
    <br>
    The Fall term this year was extremely busy with classes, committee work,
  conference organization, and such. It is pretty much a blur. In the last 
 two months we put our personal lives on hold and could not take many evenings
  or weekends off. This is the price that we pay in this job for the flexibility
  that we have to do things that we want during other periods of the year.
 <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We are now preparing to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma to spend Christmas with 
Scott's  family. Scott's maternal grandfather is not very well, and we are 
anxious  to get there and spend time with the family. We expect this to be 
a very special time with them. <br>
    <br>
    We wish you happy holidays and a happy new year. Keep us updated about
 what  is going on in your lives.<br>
