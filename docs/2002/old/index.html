<h2 align="center">2002: Making a Home in Alberta</h2>
 <br>
 Last time we managed to put an end-of-year letter together was at the end 
of 2000. We had moved from Delaware to Alberta in Canada on that year, had 
taken jobs at the University of Alberta, and had bought a house built in 1954
across the street from the campus of the university. We were then planning 
a major remodeling of the house. <br>

 The remodeling did take place in 2001. We lived in a dusty and sometimes 
cold basement from February to June of that year. The house was pretty much 
gutted and put back together. We added many windows, made the kitchen very 
open, improved insulation, re-plumbed, etc. The main parts of the interior 
of the house are now done. Although we moved upstairs in June of 2001, the 
final touches on the house were not completed until the end of that year.
<br>
 <br>
 We were also quite busy during 2001 with traveling. I went to the Canary 
Islands, Genova, and September 11 found me in a nice spot in Brazil. Scott
spent another period in London for his annual Navy active duty period, but
then took a leave of absence from his Navy job, thus he was not traveling
as much to Seattle, but we both kept traveling to different places in North
America as both of our jobs require attending several conferences. <br>

 For Christmas and New Year of 2001 we went back to the South of Brazil,
rented a house at a <a
 href="http://www.santa-catarina.net/ciudades/portobelo.htm">nice spot at
the beach</a> and spend about 12 days with my immediate family. My niece
and nephew have grown a lot. We again had a great time cooking, taking long
walks along the beach, going for boat rides, etc.<br>
 <br>
 I was happy to host several professional colleagues here in Edmonton in
the Winter term. In January we went for our annual departmental Ski trip to
Jasper. As I decided that skiing is not for me I took up snow shoeing through
the woods with a group of non-skiers. We also went again through the <a
 href="http://www.jasperbeyondthebeatenpath.com/winter-icewalk.htm">Maligne
Canyon </a>crawl, a wonderful experience in a beautiful canyon. We walked
over the frozen river and saw beautiful cascading frozen water falls.<br>

 After a busy Winter term (that is the way they call what is known as the 
``Spring term'' in the USA here --- for a reason), my annual travel to Europe
took me to Grenoble in France and Berlin in Germany. I enjoyed very much
both visits. Visiting Berlin was very special because of all the different 
layers of dramatic history that are evident in that place. In the meantime 
we also re-hired our home re-modelers to add a deck to the back of the house 
and to redo the front and back steps, and all the walks around the house.<br>
 <br>

 Starting at the end of June, we had a very busy Summer.  Nonetheless we
had time to host a bbq in our newly completed back deck for my gay and lesbian
swimming team. We were very fortunate with good weather for all our back
yard events this Summer. We received professional colleagues from Quebec
and Michigan, and went back to the <a
 href="http://www.brewsteradventures.com/ShadowLake/">Shadow Lake Lodge</a>. 
 A group of primitive but very comfortable cabins up in the mountain close
to a lake. You only can get there hiking or on horses. They provide very
good food, and we spent the days hiking to different beautiful spots.<br>

 Scott's parents came to visit along with his brother Brett and his nephew 
Braden in July. We went with the entire group to visit Drumheller and see
the <a href="http://www.tyrrellmuseum.com">world-class dinosaur museum</a>
there. We even had a chance to try to feed Braden to a dinosaur, but he would
not take him. We also explored several sites in Edmonton, such as the <a
 href="http://www.fortedmontonpark.com">Fort Edmonton Park</a>. After Scott's
parents went home, we took Brett and Braden to a <a
 href="http://www.brewsteradventures.com/kgrhorse.html">horse back riding
trip</a> through the Kananaskis area. We spent three days riding horses,
6 to 8 hours a day, and stayed in cabins in the back country. The views were
just magnific, and we had lots of fun. Braden said that it was one of the
best vacations that he ever had.<img src="Dinosaur.jpeg"

  That was in spite of some frequent whining after several hours on the back 
of a horse during <img src="TP.jpeg" alt="Morning Shower" width="300"
 height="146" align="right">
 the trip (which I could relate to!). In one of the pics you can see Scott 
going into the TP for his morning shower.<br>

 Edmonton hosted several conferences in the areas of artificial intelligence 
and databases at the end of the Summer. My Ph.D. adviser attended one of the
conferences, and brought his family with him. It was very nice to catch up
with them and see how much the kids have grown. <br>

 My mom, my step-dad, and my sister arrived in early August. We rented a
motor home and went for a tour of the province of Alberta for 9 days. We
started in the badlands/Drumheller area, and finished in the Kananaskis region
(where they had have the G-8 summit in June). This was the first time that
any one of us had traveled on a motor home. It was very enjoyable and confortable. 
The campsites in Alberta are very well equipped and confortable, and we liked 
to be able to be together, playing cards and visiting while traveling from 
one site to another. My mom and my stepfather were quite impressed with the 
fact that there was still snow in the mountains at the end of the Summer. 
Kananaskis is a beautiful mountain region. We had lots of fun cooking together, 
playing games, and visiting. <br>
 <br>
 When we made back to Edmonton we were quite busy visiting several of the 
sites around here, including the Fort Edmonton Park where there re-enact the
early settlers life and show several historical periods, the <a
 href="http://www.cd.gov.ab.ca/enjoying_alberta/museums_historic_sites/site_listings/ukrainian_heritage_village/index.asp">Ukrainian 
Village</a> where they re-enact one day in the life of the small village
in the 1920s, the <a href="http://www.westedmall.com/home/homepage.asp">West
Edmonton Mall</a>, and the Devonian Botanical Gardens.<br>
 <br>
 We were also busy getting ready for our big 10-year anniversary party that
took place on August 18. We had a beautiful warm sunny day, many of our friends
attended. We were specially thrilled that our neighbors from Delaware were
traveling through Alberta and managed to work our celebration in their travel
plans. We hired Heather Bishop, a Canadian folk singer to entertain. It was
a lovely day, we received well wishes from friends all over the world and
were very happy. Most of you have seen the <a
 href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Eamaral/party">pictures of our anninversary 
celebration</a> on my web site.<br>

 In spite of all this activities, we managed to have a nice vegetable garden. 
And my Mom enjoyed very much the opportunity to harvest fresh salad greens 
and vegetables to cook some of our meals.<br>
 <br>
 In April we started the process to adopt a child. We attended a workshop
in June, and finished our ``dear birth parents'' letter late in August soon
after my family left. With this we entered ``the pool'' of waiting prospective
adoptive parents. We now have to wait for a birth mother to pick us as her
chosen adoptive family. In recent communication with the <a
 href="http://www.adoptionbychoice.ab.ca/">adoption agency</a>, we learned
that our file is moving quite slowly through the process, and our expectation
is that we will be waiting 2-3 years before we have ''a matching''. A gay
couple that live close to us adopted a baby a year ago, from time to time
we babysit for them.<br>
 <br>
 The Fall term this year was extremely busy with classes, committee work, 
conference organization, and such. It is pretty much a blur. In the last
two months we put our personal lives on hold and could not take many evenings 
or weekends off. This is the price that we pay in this job for the flexibility 
that we have to do things that we want during other periods of the year. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 We are now preparing to go to Tulsa, Oklahoma to spend Christmas with Scott's 
family. Scott's maternal grandfather is not very well, and we are anxious 
to get there and spend time with the family. We expect this to be a very special
time with them. <br>
 <br>
 We wish you happy holidays and a happy new year. Keep us updated about what 
is going on in your lives.<br>
