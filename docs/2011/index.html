	  We spent our 2010 Christmas and New Year Holidays at Vovo's
          beach house in Xangrila' in Brazil. It was great to see
          family and friends there again. One of the highlights for
          Daniel was a rainy afternoon that just he and me went to the
          beach and we got invited to join in an "all-ages" pick-up
          soccer game. With my non-exhisting soccer skills playing
          that game on the rain for 1.5 hours was torture. But Daniel
          was having so much fun that it was worth it.</p>

	<p> Two days before Christmas Leonor, a very good friend (and
          mother of my college mate Beto, suddenly passed away in
          Porto Alegre. Thus I dashed from the beach to Porto Alegre
          to be with them during the overnight vigil and then drove
          back to the beach to bake cookies for Santa with Daniel. I
          was very saddened with Leonor's passing but felt fortunate
          that I could be there to share this moment with my close
          friend Beto, her only son. </p>

	<p>After Christmas we took a couple of days with my sister
          Salete to go to the hill towns where we got to see
          "Gramado's Christmas" a great show put on the streets of a
          very nice touristic city in the South of Brazil. It was a
          great event, but Daniel was puzzled as to why they would
          create artificial snow in the middle of the Summer. When we
          came home from the beach in Brazil to Edmonton we found
          about a meter of snow accumulated on our walks. A week later
          we kept our family tradition of a
          "Christmas-after-Christmas" celebration at home with a few
          friends.</p>

	  In February we got a phone call from Daniel's half sister,
	  Mak, to let us know that their mother, Belinda, had passed
	  away in Calgary. We learned later that she had had sudden
	  major bleeding in her brain and had suffered a very quick
	  brain death. She still survived a week after that, but there
	  was no hope of recovery. She was only 38 years old. It took
	  several months for Daniel to comprehend what had happened
	  because he only had contact with her once a year. In May,
	  when we went to visit Mak and their other half-sister,
	  Emily, Daniel saw Mak without Belinda for the first
	  time. That is when it was clear to me that he realized that
	  his mother was gone. I am glad that Daniel and Belinda had
	  had such a nice visit the year before and I got pictures of
	  them having fun together.</p>
	<p> In November Emily came with her family from Calgary to
	  Edmonton to visit with Daniel. Daniel was very happy to
	  share some of his greatest passions with her: we went
	  together to an Edmonton Halloween Symphony for Kids (Daniel
	  loves symphony concerts) and Emily's family came to see
	  Daniel play a hockey game.

	<p>In March we got busy traveling. I went on two trips to
	  Europe and Scott went on two trips to Florida. On my first
	  trip I went to Karlshure and also visited Stuttgart for a
	  weekend. On the second trip I briefly visited Frankfurt,
	  then went to Saarbrucken, Muenster, Rheine, and Cologne in
	  Germany, then to Chamonix in France and a brief stop in
	  Geneva in Switzerland before flying back home. I went to
	  Rheine to visit with my friends Matthias and Anja. They are
	  a couple that I met on a flight from Houston to Amsterdam in
	  December of 2009. We have kept corresponding regularly via
	  email, and they invited me to come and visit during my trip
	  to Germany. They were very gracious hosts and I had a
	  wonderful time visiting that part of Germany, took a cruise
	  in the Rheine river, and went up the stiple in the great
	  cathedral in Cologne with Matthias.</p>

	<p>The week in between my two trips to Germany Scott went to
	Florida for a meeting on the project that he was working
	on. Then he came back just in time for me to leave again. But
	this time, while I was traveling in Europe, Scott and Daniel
	went on a trip to Orlando with Scott's parents, aunt Diane,
	and Daniel's cousins Laureen and Lexi. With three kids of
	similar age, they kept busy going to amusement parks and
	having fun at the pool in the condominium where they
	stayed.</p>

<p>Late in 2010 we discovered that some of the issues with Daniel in
school were related to the fact that he has Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Once we started treatment his ability
to focus improved significantly. In addition he has some combination
of what professionals call "Learning Disabilities." Both Scott and
myself went to several seminars to learn about the condition and about
best practices and strategies.</p>

<p> Late in 2010 I started a "home school"
activity with Daniel. Every Saturday and Sunday that we are both home
we spend the whole morning doing home school. I discovered two very
good programs, one
called <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/a-better-way-to-teach-math/">Jump
Math</a> and the other
the <a href="http://www.readamerica.net/virtualcliniccourse4.asp">
Reading Clinic</a>, which uses a method called "Phono-Graphix" to
teach reading. This method worked much better for Daniel than the
memorization of frequent words that the school was using. We also
worked through the
entire <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/typing/">BBC Dance Mat
Typing</a> program so that Daniel could get some keyboard skills. We kept
working on home school every week throughout the year. My main goal was
for him to build up his academic confidence and to be able to remain
integrated in our neighborhood school. We had counselors working with
Daniel to help him deal with the reactions of his classmates to his
condition. We also had to do lots of advocacy and work with the
school, and I joined the school parent's council to ensure that we are
well connected with the school. One thing that we learned is that to
be an efficient advocate you have to "come out" and talk about these
issues with other parents and people around our lifes. Now Daniel is
doing well. He is still behind his class, but there is an
individualized academic plan for him. He is learning at a pace that he
can manage. He is happy to go to school and he feels like he is
successful at school. My expectation is that we will have to be doing
additional work at home with him for a long time. People with ADHD have to deal with their condition for their entire life.</p>

	<p>In April I managed to make a brief visit to my alma-matter
           school in Austin (I was an invited speaker at the Computer
           Architecture seminar at UT Austin) before going to Toronto
           for a regular research meeting at IBM. It was great to stay
           overnight at Joydeep Ghosh, my Ph.D. supervisor, and to
           visit with his family. Too bad I missed seeing Egidio in my
           brief visit to Austin.</p>

	<p>We had two major home improvement projects this Summer. The
           first was to replace the roof of our garage. It was a great
           family project. Daniel was a great help throughout the
           project and Scott worked very hard with me on that too. The
           second one I did by myself. It was to open up all the
           soffit around our house to cut larger vents to allow better
           ventilation in the attic. The goal is to prevent ice
           damming from melting snow by keeping the attic cooler
           during the Winter. It was a lot of work, but when I was
           done putting everything back into place, no one could tell
           that I had done anything! While I worked on the soffit
           Scott was busy with the garden. He did some new landscaping
           and planted a nice vegetable garden. This Summer we also
           hired a company to redo the concrete for our garage and
           driveway. Then we got a very nice basketbal hoop for Daniel
           to play in the driveway.

<p>In June I went to a conference to San Jose in California. It was
great to catch up with professional colleagues such as Barbara Rider
and Laurie Hendren and many others. I was also fortunate to meet a
former University of Alberta student, Luca Piredu, who I enjoy to
visit with and who has moved to Italy several years ago. I also took
the opportunity to catch up with my friends Guillaume and Kurt, from
my graduate school days, while I was there. Peng Zhao, my former
Ph.D. student, now works for Huawei. He invited me to give an invited
talk at Huawei while I was in San Jos'e. It was great to get to know a
bit more about this fast growing company and to catch up with
Peng.</p>

<p>On the way back to Edmonton I stopped by Corvallis to
give a talk at Oregon State University and to meet and catch up with
my friends Kagan and Irem (also from my Austin days).</p>

<p>Daniel had a very busy Summer with "Cool School," which was a
combination of sports and academics, and many sport Summer Camps. His
favorite ones were soccer and hockey camps. In some weeks he did
half-day camps so that we could work on "home-school" for the rest of
the day.</p>

	<p>In the mid of July I went on a small academic tour to
	Brazil where I visited three universities. I was very well
	received by Liria Sato at University of Sao Paulo (USP); Edson
	Borin and Sandro Rigo at Unicamp, and by Alba Melo at
	University of Brasilia (UnB). It was whirlwind tour with a
	talk at a different university on a different city each day,
	but it was a great way to reconnect with some of my colleagues
	in Brazil.  My dear friend Gloria took a bus from Santos after
	work and went to Sao Paulo so that she could treat me to a very nice
	and special one-on-one dinner on my only night in Sao
	Paulo.</p>

	<p> On that trip I also got to visit with my whole family
	in Brasilia where we celebrated by brother's 50th
	birthday. After the celebration we went on an overnight trip
	to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapada_dos_Veadeiros_National_Park">Chapada dos Viadeiros</a>, a beautiful place
	with a rugged landscape and many water falls in the state of
	Goias. Another highlight of this trip was to reconnect with
	Joao Campari, a dear friend that I had not seen since our
	Austin graduate school days. It was also great to meet Otavio,
	Joao's partner for many years. Thus, this year I got to see
	most of my friends from my years in Austin Texas</p>

<p>On my way to Brazil I made a stop in Dallas to drop Daniel off with
his American grandparents. He had over a week of intense fun at their
house. Grandma arranged many playmates and visits for him. He also had
a great time helping Grandpa count and organize his extensive
historical guns collection. While in Dallas I had time to go and have
lunch with my friend Pedro and his wife Claudia. It was nice to catch
up. I picked Daniel up in Dallas on my way back from Brazil. During
this time Scott took some personal time off traveling in the Canadian
Rocky Mountains (I joked that this was the best plan for a family
vacation: put each member of the family into a different
country!). Unfortunately Scott had two shoulder dislocations during
his trip and ended up going to hospitals in an ambulance twice.</p>

	  were a great success. We had such a beautiful day for our

	  mood. For the kid's party at the park a friend organized a
	  soccer game and we got commemorative t-shirts printed for
	  all the kids that came. My friend Silvia made one beautiful
	  theme cake for each of the parties. As per tradition Gaga
	  and Grandpa came to Edmonton to help organize the parties
	  and to celebrate with us. At our Garden party we toasted

	<p> Late in August Scott, Daniel and I went on a trip to a
	lodge in the Mountains. In previous years Scott and I had gone
	to back-country lodges that can only be accessed by +/- 10 Km
	hikes. This time we wanted to take Daniel along with us and we
	were not sure that starting with a 10 Km hiking was a good
	idea. Thus we went to
	the <a href="http://www.crossriver.ca/">Cross River Wilderness
	Centre</a>, a lodge to which we could drive. It is in a
	beautiful spot with very nice hikes nearby, and they had a
	wonderful chef that prepared great meals. The three of us went
	on a day hike. Daniel was very excited because he did very
	well and enjoyed very much hiking. He wanted to know when we
	would go back to a place like that. Our hike was along the
	Cross river, we walked by a large canyon with some beautiful
	waterfalls and stopped for a picnic at a nice river beach
	where the Cross river meets the Kootenay river. The water was
	extremely cold. Nonetheless, being a Canadian kid, Daniel
	stripped to his underwear and waded into the water for a
	while.

<p>Right before the start of the term I had to chair an expert panel
at an international conference that took place at
the <a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/">Banff Centre</a>. It was nice
to meet Tulsi, Parimala, and their kids there. I took Scott and Daniel
with me and they enjoyed visiting around Banff while I worked. On the
day that we went back we all went to a short horse-back riding at the
base of the mountains. Daniel was proud that he could handle his horse
well.</p>

<p>Early in September hockey happened to our family. Daniel has been
interested in hockey since he was 2-year-old and has always watched
hockey on TV. His favorite thing to do in the home-school breaks is to
play floor hockey in the basement. Thus, in the Winter we put him on
an a learn-to-skate program in our neighborhood. The lessons were in
an outdoor rink and the temperature cut-off for lesson cancellations
was -18 C (-0.4 F). With the cold February and March that we had in
Edmonton, it was often -18 C when we were having the lessons. Daniel
liked skating so much that he wanted to stay skating after the lessons
even with such low temperatures. Then in August Daniel had a hockey
camp at the University. It was only 3-hours per day, but Daniel was
always exhausted at the end.</p>

<table border=0 width="100%" nosave="">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<p> Throughout September Daniel had hockey try-outs to
	  establish in which tier he would play, and then early in
	  October we met his coach and team: "The Silver Bullets."
	  They were a tier 8 team (tier 1 is the highest, tier 10 is
	  the lowest).  We were very fortunate, Coach Mike is
	  outstanding and we all like him very much. Daniel ranks
	  Coach Mike as the best teacher that he ever had. Having a
	  child in hockey is a very big commitment and we had no idea
	  what we were getting into until we became "hockey parents."
	  There is a practice and a game every weekend. Even though
	  there are more than 35 skating rinks in Edmonton, ice time
	  is a very scarce resource (there are also more than 60,000
	  kids playing hockey in the province of Alberta). Therefore,
	  the times and locations for practices and games vary a
	  lot. One Saturday morning we had to be at the arena at 6 AM
	  for a hockey practice. Plus, there is all the equipment to
	  keep track, carry, put on, take off, etc. For safety
	  reasons, if one piece of equipment is missing, the child
	  cannot go into the ice. Also, if you want your kid to have
	  fun on the ice, he needs to improve his skating skills. So,
	  we started taking Daniel some evenings during the week to
	  "public skating," which is one-hour in which an arena is
	  open to anyone that wants to come and skate around the
	  ice. That led us to discover this entire Canadian culture to
	  which we were oblivious until then. In a way it is similar
	  to Spanish or Italian villagers going for a stroll around the
	  Piazza after dinner. The difference is that Canadian lace up
	  their skates and loop around an arena.</p>

<p> We have recorded some of Daniel games and put some clips on
youtube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktxyI29xd3Y">Jacob's
Goal</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/Io0zGmj1iqg">Taytum's great
shot</a> (Taytum is the only girl in Daniel's
team), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UoqZn9FMBA">Matthew's
goal</a>. Daniel usually plays defence, his jersey is #16. In one game
in December he played as the <a href="http://youtu.be/47s7Srgky3I">
goal keeper</a> (something that he had wanted to do for a long
time). He did very well in the goal and was cheered by his whole team
and parents when we got back to the locker room. Playing hockey has
been great to boost Daniel's confidence and to increase his circle of
mates.</p>

<p>In October we learned that our close friend Fran Moore is moving
back to Brisbane in Australia. Since Daniel was born Fran has been an
Auntie/Grandmother figure in his life. She has always been our main
support when we need some to watch over Daniel because of our travels
or professional responsibilities. Fran was also the manager for my
department. She will be sorely missed both personally and
professionally. When Daniel learned that she was moving, his first
reaction was: "But who will take care of me then?"</p>

<p>The contract under which Scott was working on research at the Faculty of Medice ended in September. He still kept busy finishing off some of the writing for that research for a few months. Now he is looking into what to do next.</p?

<p>Although I was teaching two classes in the Fall, I still managed to
take two professional trips, one to Toronto to meet with colleagues at
IBM, and also for the 10th anynversary of a workshop that we started
at the Center for Advanced Studies Conference (CASCON) a decade
ago. It was nice to go out and celebrate an important promotion of Kit
Barton, a very successful former Ph.D. student who joined IBM years
ago. My second trip was to Seattle to attend Supercomputing, a big
conference and an amazing trade fair for high-performance
computing. There I had a chance to have a rare one-on-one dinner with
Guang Gao, my post-doc supervisor when I was in Delaware, and a great
friend.</p>

<p>At the University I continue to stay very busy with my many
commitments to my graduate students, to the university, and to the
research community. This year I became a member of the University
Senate, which put me in contact with a much wider circle of people
from the community that supports the university. One thing that has
been nice in the last few weeks is the recognition of my teaching by
my students. Receiving a note from the Dean highlighting that my
students rank me as one of the top instructors in the Faculty of
Science and receiving personal notes from students stating that I
afforded them one of the best learning.experiences in our program
feels nice. It was even more meaningful when some of these notes came
from students that did not very well (grade wise) in the class. I
believe that my teaching has benefitted a lot from my work at home
with a child with learning disabilies.</p>

<p>Early in December Scott underwent a surgery to address the issue
with his shoulder dislocations. It was a day surgery and he did not
need to stay overnight in the hospital, even though he was under
general anhestetic for close to two hours. After the surgery he was
under strong pain killers and has to keep his arm imobilized for six
weeks before starting therapy. The evening after his surgery I was
cutting a squash for dinner --- I was in a hurry to get it done before
going to pick Daniel up at the after school care --- and the piece of
squash that was under my chef's knife slipped and the knife caught the
end of my thumb. Thus, I ended up in the emergency to get several
stiches through my nail. I will not loose any function on my thumb,
but there will be a scar. But for now Scott can only use one arm and I
have only one opposing thumb. It is a challenge to tight skates and
Daniel is the only one that can do buttons in our house.</p>

<p>This was such a great year to reconnect with mentors and friends. I
am now finishing composing this blog as we are about to take off to
Toronto where we will connect to Dallas in our way to Ardmore in
Oklahoma where we will bake the cookies to expect the arrival of Santa
Claus at Scott's parents house.</p>

<p>We wish you all very enjoyable holidays.</p>
